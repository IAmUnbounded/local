GSoC2017: Face alignment

Pull request : https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/pull/1199

Face alignment is a computer vision technology for identifying the geometric structure of human faces in digital images. Given the location and size of a face, it automatically determines the shape of the face components such as eyes and nose.

The main aim of the project is an implementation of an excellent paper from this year's Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference: One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan
